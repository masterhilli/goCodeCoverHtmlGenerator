{"name":"CodeCoverageHTMLGenerator for GO","tagline":"#GO #CodeCoverage #AllPackages #HTMLCodeCoverage #Cover","body":"### Welcome to the Project.\r\nThis is a project that creates an executable that can be started in the top folder of your GO-Project and creates an HTML file directly in the started folder, where you can see all your Code Coverage for all GO-Files. \r\n\r\nThat means you do not have to go to each package to create and view the code coverage, but you can see it in a single html file!\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Creates the code coverage file for each folder where a *test.go is located\r\n* Copies your packages to your GOPATH (needed for Html Generation by go tool)\r\n* Creates a single HTML file in the executed path with the Code Coverage of all your go files.\r\n\r\n### Open Issues\r\n* Copy of files to GOPATH is currently using xcopy of Windows and so the program is not yet compatible with other OS\r\n* add starting package name as cmdline argument -> currently this is fixed to github.com\r\n* currently does not allow spaces in directories or files\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthor: @masterhilli\r\nYear: 2016\r\n\r\n### License\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
